# Restrict EC2 IAM role permission to specific Windows users for AWS Systems Manager. 
by Siavash Irani

## Background
A customer in consulting segment wants to use AWS Systems manager session manager for managing their ec2 instances.

## Challenge
One of the requirement of AWS systems manager is to have an IAM role attached to the instance. This allows ssm-user to interact with AWS using the AWS role permissions. The problem customer had was if they attach an IAM role to the Windows instance, not only it allows ssm-user to interact with AWS, but also any other Windows user which logs in to the instance will have access based on the IAM role. 

## Solution
The proposed solution was to use Windows firewall to block traffic to IMDS(instance meta-data service) to the specific windows user.
