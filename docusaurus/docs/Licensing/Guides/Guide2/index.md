# License Mobility
by Christine Megit

Eligible Microsoft server applications can often be deployed on AWS using existing licenses. This allows you to more easily move your workloads to the Amazon Web Services cloud, without any additional Microsoft software licensing fees. This benefit is available to Microsoft Volume Licensing customers with eligible server applications covered by active Microsoft Software Assurance (SA) contracts. Not only will License Mobility make the transition easier for existing SA customers, it provides customers who prefer to purchase perpetual licenses the ability to continue doing so while still taking advantage of the efficiencies of [the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/). Keep in mind that when you choose to bring in your existing SQL Server licenses, you cannot utilize AMIs with SQL Server that you purchase from AWS through license-included instances. You must bring in your own licenses using your own software media.

## How to Sign Up 
All customers using License Mobility through Software Assurance must complete a license verification process and Microsoft will ensure that you have eligible licenses with active Software Assurance. To get a copy of the License Mobility Verification Form, go to: https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Forms?lang=1&year=2016. This form should be submitted up to 10 days after bringing your licenses to AWS.

The License Mobility Verification Form has a section to provide information about the Authorized Mobility Partner. Please use microsoft@amazon.com as the email address, Amazon Web Services as the Partner name, and aws.amazon.com as the partner website. For further guidance, consult Microsoft's [License Mobility Verification Guide](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/9/b/79bd917e-760b-48b6-a266-796b3e47c47a/License_Mobility_Customer_Verification_Guide.pdf) (pdf).

The e-mail address you can submit the form to is included within the form itself. Microsoft will provide confirmation to you and to AWS that you have completed this verification process. You may deploy your application server software prior to the verification process being completed. In fact, you can deploy up to ten days before submitting the form. Customers are responsible for managing true-ups and renewals as required under their agreement with Microsoft.
